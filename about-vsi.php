                                <p>
                                Dearly beloved, <br/>
                                A hearty welcome to Haven  World of Blessing also know as Vision Sanctuary International.
                                <br/>Today is your first time of visiting us and we would love for you to be more than a visitor.
                                Being in Haven World of Blessings is more than being in a church, it is a vision and when you worship at Vision Sanctuary International, you learn more than just the letters, it is the spirit of the word and something about it is the fact that the spirit of God gets a hold of your life and then his vision becomes real not only to you, but he makes that vision real in such a way that others get to know what the word really is by watching the word of God manifested in your life every day.
                                That’s what we do; we share God’s word every day, as we minister the word God takes root in you and then you become exactly what God wants you to be. That’s the reason I love people being in Haven World of Blessing because they are being a part of something that is more than a Church, it’s a vision; God’s Vision!
                                <br/>One thing is certain you will come back with a testimony and your vision, which is God’s purpose for your life, will surely become a reality. 
                                Please take some time to go through our life transforming resources; our blogs, read our articles and get connected for a journey of God’s divine blessing. 
                                We are so happy you came today and would love for you to keep coming. We would love to know you more.
                                If you would love to know more about the Ministry we are always happy to help kindly reach us below…
